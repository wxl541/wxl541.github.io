        <p>A <strong>volcano</strong> is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.</p>

        <p>On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates.</p>
        
        <p>Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core-mantle boundary, 3,000 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr> (1,900 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) deep in the Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.</p>

      <section id="etymology">
        <h2>Etymology</h2>

        <p>The word volcano is derived from the name of Vulcano, a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy whose name in turn comes from Vulcan, the god of fire in Roman mythology.
          
        <p>The study of volcanoes is called volcanology, sometimes spelled vulcanology.</p>

      <section id="volcanic-features">
        <h2>Volcanic features</h2>

        <p>The most common perception of a volcano is of a conical mountain, spewing lava and poisonous gases from a crater at its summit; however, this describes just one of the many types of volcano. The features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors.</p>

        <article>
          <h3>Fissure vents</h3>

          <p>Volcanic fissure vents are flat, linear fractures through which lava emerges.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Lava domes</h3>

          <p>Lava domes are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava. They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption, as in the case of Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helens, but can also form independently, as in the case of Lassen Peak.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Cryptodomes</h3>

          <p>Cryptodomes are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge. The <time datetime="1980">1980</time> eruption of Mount St. Helens was an example; lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge, which later collapsed down the north side of the mountain.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Stratovolcanoes</h3>

          <p>Stratovolcanoes (composite volcanoes) are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and tephra in alternate layers, the strata that gives rise to the name.</p>
          
          <p>They are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Classic examples include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mayon Volcano in the Philippines, and Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli in Italy.</p>

        <h2>Decade Volcanos</h2>

        <p>The Decade Volcanoes are 16 volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (<abbr title="International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior">IAVCEI</abbr>) as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas.</p>
        
        <p>They are named Decade Volcanoes because the project was initiated as part of the United Nations-sponsored International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (the 1990s).</p>
        
        <p>The 16 current Decade Volcanoes are:</p>

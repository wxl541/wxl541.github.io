            <p>This is where my Graphic Design work is housed. Digital art has become
                my favorite art medium. These projects display my range of graphic design abilities.

                        This is a digital collage I made in 2022 with printed, hand-cut, and scanned images 
                        featuring Frank Ocean and his musical artistry. The images were individually styled
                        and placed digitally.

                        In 2022, I released merchandise to celebrate my song "sun-kissed" reaching 10,000
                        streams. These are the ads I made to promote the t-shirts.

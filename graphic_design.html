                    This is a digital collage I made in 2022 with printed, hand-cut, and scanned images 
                    featuring Frank Ocean and his musical artistry. The images were individually styled
                    and placed digitally.

                <p>
                    In 2022, I released merchandise to celebrate my song "sun-kissed" reaching 10,000
                    streams. These are the ads I made to promote the t-shirts.

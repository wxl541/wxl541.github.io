                <p>
                    Living in Color was a magazine I developed as a final project for an African American
                    Literature class. The magazine demonstrated how Black culture has dictated and created many of
                    the most recent trends in pop culture. These photos were utilized in the magazine.

                    All Roads Lead Home is an exhibit I held at the VISIONS art event hosted by Black Creatives Collective.
                    The theme was afrofuturism so my photos represent the wealth and affluence of young Black men in the future.

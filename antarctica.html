                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early 1820s when
                            British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring 
                            the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle. It wasn't until <time datetime="1840">1840</time>
                            when it was established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and a country and not merely a group of islands or an area of ocean.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century, but generally the area saw little 
                            human activity. Following World War II, however, the continent experienced an upsurge in scientific research.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support 
                            scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims and two maintain the basis for a claim, 
                            but most countries do not recognize these claims.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was 
                            negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, it entered
                            into force in <time datetime="1961">1961</time>. Also relevant to Antarctic governance are the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic 
                            Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

                                Antarctica is a country located mostly south of the Antarctic Circle. It's geographic coordinates are 
                                90 00 S, 0 00 E, which places it in the Antarctic Region. The area measures 14.2 million sq kilometers,
                                making it the second largest country, although it is a continent as well.

                            <p>Antarctica does have maritime claims. Australia, Chile, and Argentina claim <abbr title="Exclusive Economic Zone">EEZ</abbr>
                                rights or similar over 200 nm extensions seaward from their continental claims, but like the claims 
                                themselves, these zones are not accepted by other countries; 22 of 29 Antarctic Treaty consultative parties 
                                have made no claims to Antarctic territory, although Russia and the United States have reserved the right 
                                to do so, and no country can make a new claim; also see the Disputes - international entry

                        <h3>Environment</h3>
                            
                            <p>
                                Antarctica is the coldest, windiest, and driest country on Earth. The severe low temperatures vary with 
                                latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation, but the Antarctic Peninsula has 
                                the most moderate climate. Higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and usually average slightly 
                                below freezing. The summers are characterized by continuous daylight, while winters bring continuous darkness; 
                                persistent high pressure over the interior brings dry, subsiding air that results in very little cloud cover.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The terrain matches the climate. It's made up of about 99% thick continental ice sheet and 1% barren rock, with
                                average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 m. The mountain ranges go up to nearly 5,000 m. Glaciers form ice shelves 
                                along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent.
                            </p>

                            <p>There are only a few ice free coastal areas.</p>
                                <ul>

                                <p>Antarctica doesn't have a conventional long form for its name.

                                does have an etymology. The name derives from two Greek words meaning "opposite 
                                to the Arctic" or "opposite to the north."

                        <h3>Legal System</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Antarctica is administered through annual meetings - known as Antarctic Treaty Consultative 
                                    Meetings - which include:
                                </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Consultative Member Nations</li>
                                        <li>Non-Consultative Member Nations</li>
                                        <li>Observer Organizations</li>
                                        <li>Expert Organizations</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p>
                                    Decisions from these meetings are carried out by these member nations (with respect to their own
                                    nationals and operations) in accordance with their own national laws. More generally, the Antarctic
                                    Treaty area, that is to all areas between 60 and 90 degrees south latitude, is subject to a number 
                                    of relevant legal instruments and procedures adopted by the states party to the Antarctic Treaty.

                        <h3>General Telecommunications</h3>

                            <p>
                            Scientists with the United States Antarctic Program at McMurdo Station have now 
                            got their hands on a Starlink terminal of their own. It is said to be improving
                            connectivity as they carry out their research. This Starlink terminal was made possible through 
                            laser links between the SpaceX satellites in orbit that eliminate the need for ground 
                            stations at the poles and makes Antarctica the seventh and final continent to receive Starlink 
                            internet coverage. There are 4,400 internet users in Antarctica which make up 100% of the country's
                            population.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Domestic Communications</h3>

                            <p>
                                Antarctica does have domestic communication. Some commerercial cellular networks 
                                operate in a small number of locations.
                            </p>

                        <h3>International Communications</h3>

                            <p>
                                Antarctica doesn't have an allocated country code for international communication.
                                Although, it does have an internet country code which is .aq. Most international 
                                communications are through satellite like the mobile Inmarsat and Iridium systems. 
                                Communication via satellite operates to and from all research stations, ships, 
                                aircraft, and most field parties.

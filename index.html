    <h2><em>For All the Dogs</em> by Drake</h2>

    <p>On Wednesday September 6, Drake revealed the official release date for his
        newest studio album, <em>For All the Dogs</em>. This is the confirmation
        fans have been waiting for surrounding the speculation of a rumoured eighth
        studio album. Known features include latin artist Bad Bunny and longtime 
        collaborator with Drake, Nicki Minaj. The album features production from on

    <h2>The Meaning Behind the Cover Art</h2>

    <p>Drake revealed the cover art before announcing the official release date of
        the album. The album art consists of a white dog with red eyes drawn in crayon on top of a
        black background. The art was actually drawn by his 5-year-old son Adonis
        Graham. Drake has notoriously received mixed reviews for his controversial 
        album art for his past three albums. Although the art received mixed reviews his son
        received a lumpsome of money from his father for the work.

    <h2>How Will This Compare to Drake's Catalogue?</h2>

    <p>
        In the past decade, Drake has managed to stay afloat, releasing hit singles and
        impactful albums. How will <em>For All the Dogs</em> stack up against
        his other hit records? Let's analyze. We'll start with his first week album
        sales.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><em>Views</em> (2016), 1,040,000 </li>
            <li><em>Scorpion</em> (2018), 732,000 </li>
            <li><em>Nothing Was the Same</em> (2013), 658,000 </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now let's look at Spotify daily streams of his top albums.</p>
        
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Album</th>
                <th>Streams</th>
            </tr>
                <td><em>Certified Lover Boy</em></td>
                <td>4,212,290</td>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Scorpion</em></td>
                <td>3,462,659</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Views</em></td>
                <td>3,413,465</td>
            </tr>
        </table>


        
       <p> It's unlikely Drake will beat his own debut week of 1,040,000 records sold.
        Yet, he does have the third most No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 charts,
        maybe he'll add another. He could also surpass his daily Spotify streams with
        this new album. Only time will tell.

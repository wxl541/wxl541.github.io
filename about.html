            </h3>
            
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm a sophomore majoring in Creative Advertising and minoring in Marketing
                    at the University of Miami. I'm a cross disciplinary artist who enjoys not only graphic design and photography,
                    but videography and fashion as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I enjoy collecting vinyl records, thrift shopping for clothes, and exploring new creative hobbies. Originally from Pennsylvania
                    I split my time between Pennsylvania and Florida, visiting home as much as I can. If you'd like to hire me, reach out to me using
                    the contact info below!
                </p>
